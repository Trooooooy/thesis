# thesis
code used for bachelor's thesis Aenetroy Vlug

All changes are marked with comments that include the word "troy", with exception of the files that are fully and almost fully written by me, which contain a comment at the top to mention it. (the files in question are average_reward.py, screen_cap.py, and frametest.py)

please refer to Sethbling's setup/user guide to for the actual setup, and be aware that the .lua files go into the bizhawk files under lua/mariq, while the .py files go into the separate mariq/qlearning folder, and .cfg files go into the mariq/qlearning/configs folder

since the code is written for an older version of Python, please install the appropriate Conda virtual environment using the provided .yml file
